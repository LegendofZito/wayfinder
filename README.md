# Wayfinder

**A fast, native file manager for Linux** — built with Tauri 2, Svelte 5, and Rust.

Wayfinder replaces Dolphin, Nemo, and Nautilus with a single clean app: dark-themed, keyboard-driven, with a docked preview pane, Windows-style timestamps, image thumbnails, USB hotplug, tabs, and full file operations — all in a 13 MB binary with no Electron overhead.
